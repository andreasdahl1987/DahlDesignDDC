# 1. Project planning

When you have an idea of which and how many switches you're going to use, you'll be best of making a plan for how to set up the **switch matrix**. Because even if you're not wiring the switches in a matrix, your swiches will be organized in a matrix in  the firmware. Each switch will have a row and column number, or in some cases several column numbers. Each slot in the matrix has a toolbox that your switch will use to work the way it should.&#x20;

Think of it as placing the switches in an Excel sheet. The switch in <mark style="background-color:green;">green</mark> with number "14" is on row 3, column 3. When refering to the switches in the code, you'll be using these adresses. So even if you have no matrix wiring, you should read through the [matrix documentation](matrix.md)&#x20;
