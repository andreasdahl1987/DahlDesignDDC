Did you ever see a computer mouse in a race car cockpit?&#x20;

Thought so!

DDC will let you use joystick switches, funky switches, buttons or even clutch paddles to control the mouse cursor. Having a mouse pad on your rig can be inconvenient, and usually it is not all that much mousing around required for sim use. So a suboptimal solution, like controlling the mouse with your steering wheel, can be great!&#x20;

| Left/right/middle click      | Move           | Scroll                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Funky push (only left click) | Funky stick    | Funky-type encoder      |
| Any button                   | Any button     | EC18-type encoder       |
|                              | Thumb stick    | rotary2Bit-type encoder |
|                              | Clutch paddles | PEC11-type encoder      |

All switches controlling the mouse cursor will work like normal switches as well, and you'll access the mouse control by holding/toggling another specific button.&#x20;

While not typically found in sim racing controllers, thumbstick switches like Alps Alpine RKJXV- and RKJX2 - series are the best alternatives to an actual mouse. They are based on two potentiometers controlling each their axis. You'll need to set up two [analog channels](analog-inputs/) for these switches.&#x20;

From DDC v3.0 these switches will have two modes; either controlling the mouse or controlling two joystick axis. When controlling joystick axis these switches can be used to look around in the cockpit, or even used as a typical console thumbstick to play your favourite non-sim games! _Before DDC 3.0 they will only be able to control the mouse cursor._&#x20;
