# LED control

There are a few things to set up to allow SimHub to make contact with your controller.&#x20;

First you'll need to[ set up a VID/PID](../3.-coding/naming-the-controller.md) for the controller.

When you've [uploaded](../3.-coding/upload.md) the firmware to your controller, you can connect to SimHub:

* Go to devices and add a new device.

* Select "Create standard device"

* Select standard LED device

* Go to USB PID/VID configuration, edit the controllers VID and PID and set the correct LED count. This is all your strips combined. &#x20;

* You can also rename the device and change the picture by left-clicking it.

* Reboot your controller and/or SimHub for SimHub to find it, press "Edit profile" under LEDs to start working with the RGB editor.  Remember that Arduino IDE can block SimHub from getting contact, so also close down Arduino IDE.&#x20;

You're all set!
