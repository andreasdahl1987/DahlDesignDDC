# DDS

DDS (Dahl Design Switch) switches are tailored for the Dahl Design iRacing [Dashboard](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Gk9mLLIOB4bOKrDCqIdJ/s/49tDWuDHhTQtCQdHWIW5/), but can of course be used any way you like, if it fits your projects. It is a function that takes a rotary switch and two pushbuttons to create a 26-position switch complex that is ideal for a menu system.&#x20;

In the example above, the switch has button numbers 1 to 26. It works like this:

* The rotary switch will scroll through numbers 1-12 OR numbers 13-24. A continous button press is produced.
* The DDButton will toggle between the two rows of 12 numbers. So if you're currently pressing "9" and hit the DDButton, you go to "21". If you're at "14" and press DDButton, you go to "2".&#x20;
* The hybridButton will lock the position the switch is currently in, and rotating the rotary now will give pulses of buttons 26/25 on CW/CCW rotation. Hitting hybridButton again will release back to being able to change the position.&#x20;
  * The state when the position is locked is refered to as "**closed hybrid**".
  * The state when position can move is refered to as "**open hybrid**".&#x20;

In the open hybrid mode the switch is a **counting** multiposition switch, as opposed to being an **absolute** multiposition switch. So phyisical position of the switch will be out of sync with button numbers. This is to allow the switch to continue where it stopped after being rotated in closed hybrid. The switch will boot to the button number it is given in 10\_MatrixAndAnalog.ino.

The DDS switches all have 4 modes, and this is automatically pushed to the bit fields for SimHub communication. It is available as the property \[DahlDesign.DDCDDSMode]:

* 0: Open hybrid
* 1: Closed hybrid
* 2 and 3 depends on the type of DDS function you use.

If your controller uses a DDS switch, you have to check for this in the properties [plugin menu](https://app.gitbook.com/s/d2E1GdYd97jTQlTu0Drn/introduction/plugin-menu).

The video below you can see how the DDS switch works together with the dashboard. Here, a funky switch alone has all the switches needed for the complex; including the rotary, DDButton and hybridButton.&#x20;

**All DDS switches can also set the bite point of your clutches.**&#x20;

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">DDS2bit()</mark>

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
DDS for an encoder in the rotary2bit category.&#x20;

Modes:

* 0: Open hybrid
* 1: Closed hybrid
* 2: 4-position switch
* 3: Incremental encoder

Set the bite point using a [biteButton().](function-button.md#bitebutton)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example" %}
`void DDS2bit(int row, int column, bool reverse)`

For a encoder on row 2 column 4+5 -> `DDS2bit(2,4, true);`

This switch has "reverese" set to true, since it is placed on the rear of the controller. Turning it CCW will now increase the count instead of reducing.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Requirements" %}
* modButton() if you want to change modes freely. modButton() not needed to change modes across presets.&#x20;
* DDButton() to swap between "layers" of 12 positions.
* hybridButton() to lock position and use rotary as incremental switch.
* biteButton() to set the bite point of clutches.
* 26 button numbers
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">DDS4bit()</mark>

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
DDS for an encoder in the rotary4bit category.&#x20;

Modes:

* 0: Open hybrid
* 1: Closed hybrid
* 2: 16-position switch. Absolute.
* 3: Incremental encoder

Set the bite point using a [biteButton().](function-button.md#bitebutton)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example" %}
`void DDS4bit(int row, int column, bool reverse)`

For a encoder on row 2 column 2+3+4+5 -> `DDS4bit(2,4, true);`

This switch has "reverese" set to true, since it is placed on the rear of the controller. Turning it CCW will now increase the count instead of reducing.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Requirements" %}
* modButton() if you want to change modes freely. modButton() not needed to change modes across presets.&#x20;
* DDButton() to swap between "layers" of 12 positions.
* hybridButton() to lock position and use rotary as incremental switch.
* biteButton() to set the bite point of clutches.
* 26 button numbers
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">DDSfunky()</mark>

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
DDS for an encoder in the funky category.&#x20;

Modes:

* 0: Open hybrid
* 1: Closed hybrid
* 2: Incremental encoder
* 3: Toggle mode. Rotating CW/CCW will turn the button numbers for incremental mode on/off and hold them.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example" %}
`void DDSfunky(int Arow, int Acol, int Bcol)`

For a encoder on row 2 column 2 + 4 -> `DDS4bit(2, 2, 4);`

As you can see, this encoder doesn't require the encoder A and B pins to be on columns next to eachother.&#x20;

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">DDSanalog()</mark>

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
DDS for a resistor ladder switch.

Modes:

* 0: Open hybrid
* 1: Closed hybrid
* 2: 12-position switch. Absolute.
* 3: Incremental switch
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example" %}
`void DDSanalog(int analogPin, int switchNumber, int pos1, int pos2, int pos3, int pos4, int pos5, int pos6, int pos7, int pos8, int pos9, int pos10, int pos11, int pos12, bool reverse)`

\
Switch setup with explainations:

DDSanalog(

A3, <- The analog pin this switch is connected to

2, <- The switch number this analog switch is assigned

16, 107, 200, 291, 383, 474, 566, 657, 749, 841, 932, 1023, <- Switch position values

false); <- Direction is not reversed, so CW rotation increasese button number.



So typed out in 30\_Switches.ino:

`DDSanalog(A3, 2, 16, 107, 200, 291, 383, 474, 566, 657, 749, 841, 932, 1023,false);`

* modButton() if you want to change modes freely. modButton() not needed to change modes across presets.&#x20;
* DDButton() to swap between "layers" of 12 positions.
* hybridButton() to lock position and use rotary as incremental switch.
* biteButton() to set the bite point of clutches.
* 26 button numbers

Set the bite point using a [biteButton().](function-button.md#bitebutton)
{% endtab %}
