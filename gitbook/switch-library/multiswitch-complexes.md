# Multiswitch complexes

Multiswitch complexes refers to rotaries and buttons/toggles working together to produce more button numbers than the individual switches could do alone.&#x20;

There are two main variants:

* Hybrid
* Multifunction

Comparison:

|                     | Hybrid                                                                                | Multifunction                                         |

| Supported sim       | Sim needs to accept simultaneous key presses as bindings. Only iRacing comes to mind. | <mark style="background-color:green;">Any</mark>      |

As you can see, both have their strengths and weaknesses. Below are the functions explained in detail. The multifunction switch functions are listed here, whie the hybrid functions are listed in the various encoder categories.&#x20;

### Hybrid

* The idea if the hybrid system is a rotary that holds a button number. Rotating CW or CCW will increase or decrease the button number. The In the case above, it counts to 15, but any number of positions can be set. Then, a button set up with a hybridButton() function can be pressed to lock the position of the rotary, and then the rotary can be used to make button pulses on CW and CCW rotation - while still holding the button number it was holding before hybridButton was pressed.&#x20;
* In the example above, the rotary has been rotated to position 4, then hybrid button pressed. The switch is still producing a continous button 4 press, but will in addition give pulses of button number 16 on CCW rotation and 17 on CW rotation.&#x20;
* In iRacing, which allows key combinations as bindings, you can use this to map several adjustments that are typically increase/decrease to this switch. In the case above, the switch has 30 combinations. 1+16, 1+17, 2+16, 2+17, 3+16, 3+17, etc.&#x20;
* The function works really elegantly with a encoder that has integrated push button.&#x20;
* The biggest downside is that the position of the physical switch will not be in sync with button numbers pressed, so there is no point in labeling the controller with switch positions. You can however make a graphic in your dashboard (at least when using SimHub) that reflects the switch position, using the joystick button number properties.&#x20;

The various hybrid functions are listed under their respective encoder/rotary categories.

### Multifunction

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The idea of the multifunction system is that a 12-position switch controls  the button numbers of two buttons (or an encoder that pulses button presses on CW/CCW rotation). The system produces 24 button numbers.
* In the example above, the 12-position switch is in position 8, meaning button 1 is button number 15 and button 2 is button number 16. Flicking the rotary to position 9 will give you different button number outputs from the two buttons; 17 and 18.&#x20;
* The same way as the hybrid system, this is useful for setting up several adjustments to very few switches. You could set up ABS +/- in position 1, TC +/- in position 2, Engine map +/- in position 3, etc.&#x20;
* The main advantages of this approach in comparison to the hybrid system are:
  * There are no simulatneous button presses, so all kinds of sims are supported.
  *   The physical position of the switch matches the button numbers, so you can go ahead and label your controller accordingly, as below.&#x20;

      <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
*   There are 24 button and **36 button** variants. Really, the product of both are 24 functional buttons. The difference is that in the 36 button variant the 12-position switch is also given button numbers to reflect its position, which is useful if you want information about the switch position in SimHub for dashboard purposes.

Switch setup with explainations:

multiFunction2Bit24(
