# 5. Order from JLCPCB

You can of course use the project files to order from any PCB manufatorer, but I'm only going to write a guide for JLCPCB, since I've build this circuit with their component library in mind.&#x20;

### 1. Go to JLCPCB.com and upload your Gerber folder

It is gonna take a bit of time, just wait for the full upload.

### 2. Change the following settings

* Layers: 4
* Impedance control: Yes
* Layer stackup: JLC04161H-7628
* Remove order number: Specify a location

Other settings left to default (as shown in the image above).&#x20;

You can change Surface Finish to **LeadFree HASL or ENIG**, but changing color of the board will come with a big cost increase because it is not available as PCBA type Economic. &#x20;

### 3. Check PCB Assembly

* Make sure you've got **Economic PCBA** type checked, it is way cheaper than **Standard**. If you cant select it you did something wrong in step 1.&#x20;
* You can set the **PCBA Qty** to 2, which is the lowest number of PCBs to get assembled.&#x20;
* Select **Confirm Parts Placement**, as it is free.&#x20;

### 4. Finalize

* Next steps is just clicking next and next, uploading the BOM and Pick\&Place file (CPL).&#x20;
* You will get an error on the component "IO", which is just a layout for all the connections used in the schematic, it is not a real component. Go ahead with "Do not place".&#x20;

* Save to cart and order!

### 5. Last note

If you didn't already have a look at [3. Edit Pick\&Place](3.-edit-pick-and-place.md), take a look at the price difference:

* Default board setup:&#x20;
* Removed both ADS1115, both PCA9555 and connectors:&#x20;
